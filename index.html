    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <hr/>

        <p>
        <strong>Data Engineer</strong> &mdash; <em>Cometa</em> <br />
        <strong>Oct 2024 &ndash; Present</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
        Designed and implemented <strong>scalable ETL pipelines</strong> and <strong>data architecture</strong> from the ground up 
        to support both <em>batch</em> and <em>real-time processing</em>. Built timer-based batch-processing pipelines using 
        <strong>Google Cloud Scheduler</strong> and explored distributed processing with <strong>Apache Spark</strong>. 
        Designed and deployed a complete <strong>database schema</strong> and <strong>ingestion framework</strong>, 
        including JavaScript-based data capture systems, pipelines, and automated loaders. Within six months, 
        established a data ecosystem that grew from zero to over <strong>12 million rows of data</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Developed and deployed <strong>data services</strong> using <strong>Cloud Run</strong>, <strong>BigQuery</strong>, 
        and <strong>Cloud Storage</strong>, optimising for performance and cost efficiency. Created automated reporting 
        solutions and interactive dashboards using <strong>Looker</strong> and <strong>Grafana</strong>, integrating them into 
        a centralised web portal for unified access to data and insights. Worked extensively with 
        <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong> for database design and querying, and published internal 
        <strong>REST APIs</strong> to expose validated datasets to downstream tools.
        </p>

        <p>
        Used low-code tools such as <strong>Google AppSheet</strong> to extend data capture and insight generation 
        capabilities. Experimented with <strong>full-stack development</strong> using <strong>React</strong> to build 
        lightweight internal applications. Integrated <strong>machine learning models</strong> into document-ingestion 
        workflows for automated classification and structured storage. Collaborated closely with clients and internal 
        stakeholders to align requirements and ensure successful <em>data system adoption</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Support Engineer &amp; Asset Care Engineer</strong> &mdash; <em>Pragma</em> <br />
        <strong>Jul 2019 &ndash; Sep 2024</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
        Worked in both <em>South Africa</em> and <em>the Netherlands</em>, progressing from Asset Care Engineer to 
        Support Engineer within the organisation. As a Support Engineer, served as a client-facing problem solver 
        responsible for analysing and resolving technical support queries. Authored detailed findings and collaborated 
        with downstream teams to address root causes.
        </p>

        <p>
        Led several <strong>process improvement projects</strong> to streamline workflows and enhance departmental 
        turnaround times. Applied <strong>machine learning models</strong> to improve ticket triage and response 
        prioritisation, and implemented automation to reduce manual workloads, including automated ticket logging 
        and document workflows for knowledge transfer. Extensively utilised <strong>SQL</strong> for debugging and 
        data analysis, and developed automation solutions that increased team efficiency and client engagement.
        </p>

        <p>
        Earlier, as an Asset Care Engineer, designed and developed a <strong>low-code application</strong> using 
        <strong>OutSystems</strong> in collaboration with other engineers. The application integrated with Pragma‚Äôs 
        maintenance management system, enabling clients to establish and monetise maintenance plans. Responsible 
        for <strong>SSRS reporting</strong> across European clients, developing custom reports and dashboards based 
        on client needs.
        </p>

        <p>
        Integrated <strong>IoT solutions</strong> into maintenance systems to provide <em>real-time operational insights</em> 
        and delivered client presentations demonstrating <strong>data-driven value</strong>. Built an 
        <strong>automation tool</strong> that processed client after-hours queries and generated automated 
        acknowledgements and tickets, significantly reducing the need for <em>24/7 manual support</em>.
        </p>

    <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
    <hr/>
        <p>
        <strong>Masters Research ‚Äì Shallow and Deep Ensembles</strong><br />
        Investigated whether <strong>shallow ensembles</strong> can deliver 
        <em>similar predictive performance</em> to <strong>deep ensembles</strong> 
        at a <em>fraction of the computational and resource cost</em>. 
        Conducted a comparative analysis across multiple classification datasets 
        using diverse shallow and deep ensemble configurations, assessing 
        <strong>accuracy</strong> alongside <strong>training/inference time</strong>, 
        <strong>memory usage</strong>, and <strong>computational complexity</strong> 
        with cross-validation and appropriate statistical comparisons.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>IBM Capstone ‚Äì Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning</strong><br />
        Developed an end-to-end <strong>machine learning pipeline</strong> to predict heart disease 
        using the <strong>CRISP-DM framework</strong>. The project included 
        <em>data preprocessing</em>, <em>feature engineering</em>, <em>model selection</em>, 
        and <em>evaluation</em> using Python. The approach applied 
        <strong>classical ML algorithms</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Undergraduate Thesis ‚Äì Asset Management Platform for Additive Manufacturing</strong><br />
        Developed a conceptual <strong>asset management software platform</strong> tailored for 
        the additive manufacturing sector in Southern Africa. The project aimed to reduce 
        <strong>production lead times</strong> in the creation of 
        <em>medical prosthetics</em> through improved digital asset tracking and 
        <strong>process optimisation</strong>. Combined principles of 
        <strong>industrial engineering</strong> and <strong>system design</strong> 
        to propose a scalable framework for future implementation.
