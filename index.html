        </p>

        <p>
          At Cometa, designed and implemented scalable <strong>ETL pipelines</strong> and <strong>data architecture</strong> 
          to support both <strong>batch</strong> and <strong>real-time processing</strong>. Built timer-based pipelines using 
          <strong>Google Cloud Scheduler</strong> and explored distributed processing with <strong>Apache Spark</strong>. 
          Developed a full ingestion framework with <strong>JavaScript-based capture</strong>, a custom 
          <strong>database schema</strong>, and automated loaders. Within six months, scaled from zero to over 
          <strong>12 million rows of data</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Deployed data services using <strong>Cloud Run</strong>, <strong>BigQuery</strong>, and <strong>Cloud Storage</strong>, 
          optimised for cost and performance. Created <strong>automated reporting</strong> and dashboards via 
          <strong>Looker</strong> and <strong>Grafana</strong>, integrating them into a unified internal portal. 
          Published internal <strong>REST APIs</strong> and used <strong>low-code tools</strong> like 
          Google AppSheet for extended functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prototyped internal apps with <strong>React</strong> and embedded <strong>ML models</strong> into document 
          workflows for automated classification. Collaborated across technical and non-technical teams to 
          ensure alignment and adoption.

    <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
    <hr/>
        <p>
        <strong>Masters Research ‚Äì Shallow and Deep Ensembles</strong><br />
        Investigated whether <strong>shallow ensembles</strong> can deliver 
        <em>similar predictive performance</em> to <strong>deep ensembles</strong> 
        at a <em>fraction of the computational and resource cost</em>. 
        Conducted a comparative analysis across multiple classification datasets 
        using diverse shallow and deep ensemble configurations, assessing 
        <strong>accuracy</strong> alongside <strong>training/inference time</strong>, 
        <strong>memory usage</strong>, and <strong>computational complexity</strong> 
        with cross-validation and appropriate statistical comparisons.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>IBM Capstone ‚Äì Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning</strong><br />
        Developed an end-to-end <strong>machine learning pipeline</strong> to predict heart disease 
        using the <strong>CRISP-DM framework</strong>. The project included 
        <em>data preprocessing</em>, <em>feature engineering</em>, <em>model selection</em>, 
        and <em>evaluation</em> using Python. The approach applied 
        <strong>classical ML algorithms</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Undergraduate Thesis ‚Äì Asset Management Platform for Additive Manufacturing</strong><br />
        Developed a conceptual <strong>asset management software platform</strong> tailored for 
        the additive manufacturing sector in Southern Africa. The project aimed to reduce 
        <strong>production lead times</strong> in the creation of 
        <em>medical prosthetics</em> through improved digital asset tracking and 
        <strong>process optimisation</strong>. Combined principles of 
        <strong>industrial engineering</strong> and <strong>system design</strong> 
        to propose a scalable framework for future implementation.
